            <h2><i> What is a Desktop Computer?</i></h2>
            <p>
              Desktop computers, as the name suggest, are computers that are fitted on top of a typical office desk.
              Some <a href="https://www.techopedia.com/definition/2252/peripheral-device">peripheral devices</a>
              typically associated with desktop computers include the mouse, keyboard, monitor and power cord which
              together to enable the user to traverse through the computer. For example, the mouse and keyboard helps
              users to select and traverse through files present on the computer and the monitor displays the content of
              these file. Unlike laptops which are portable, desktop computers are built to be stationary.

            <h2><i>Brief History of Desktop Computers</i></h2>
            <p>
              Developed and first unveiled at a public New York World's Fair in the 1960s by inventor Pier Giorgio
              Pertto, the <a
                href="https://www.inexhibit.com/case-studies/olivetti-programma-101-at-the-origins-of-the-personal-computer/">Olivetti
                Programma 101</a> was the first desktop computer of its time. The Programma 101 was able to preform
              simple arithemtic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
              <br>
              <br>
              Although the Programma 101 is considered the first ever desktop computer, the first desktop computer
              mass-marketed was the HP 9001A, developed by Hewlett Packard in 1968. Throughout the years that followed,
              the desktop computer underwent significant and numerous modification in both hardware and software to
              produce the desktop computers we have today.

              <br>
              Electronic waste or E-waste, as is referred to by many, are electronic products or products containing
              electronic components which have reached the end of the life span. Numerous minerals, went into developing
              the electronic devices we have today, most of which are toxic to human health. Minerals such as:
              <li><a href='https://hazardouscomputers.weebly.com/lead-in-computers.html'>Lead</a></li>
              <li><a href='https://mcbia.com/ewasterecycle.com/?page_id=228'>Mercury</a></li>

            <ul>
              <li>These minerals spew from e-waste as a result of the improper disposal of electronic waste (e-waste) in
                landfill or other places. These minerals seeps into the soil, affecting the growth of nearby crops while
                simultaneously changing the pH value of the soil. Additionally, crops affected by these toxins are
                susceptible to illness thereby reducing the productivity levels of farmlands.</li>

            <p>

              <li>Futhermore, these toxins which seeps into the soil then leaks into underlying water bodies which
                eventually run into ponds, lake and rivers,causing <a

                affected ecosystems or organisms which drinks from these affected water bodies inadvertently develop
                ailments from which the eventually die.</li>

                local fishermen, sold in markets and bought by local consumers. These toxins then enter the human body
                after consumption of affected organisms, causing ailments such as liver, kidney and brain damages and in
                worse cases death.</li>

              A lot toxic chemicals are incorporated into the electronic produces that we have today. Chemicals that
              causes chronic ailments such as cancer, brain and kidney failure and even reproductive issues. The
              improper disposal of e-waste releases these harmful chemicals into the environments.

                failure in low dosage while higher exposure to lead can lead to death. Other chemicals such as mercury

            <h1>SOLUTIONS TO MITIGATE DESKTOPS E-WASTE ON THE ENVIRONMENT</h1>
            <p>
              E-waste and its effects have severe consequences on our lives as humans, but you can help reduce these
              effects by:
              <br>
            <ul>
              <li>âœ…Buying less unnecessary appliances. This reduces the amount of e-waste that will be diposed while
                reducing the carbon dioxide emission produced by the household.</li>
              <br>
              <li> âœ…Educating yourself of what goes into making your electronic products and their eco-friendly
                alternatives. By doing so, you are aware of the pontential harm your product(s) may have have on the
                environment. </li>
              <br>
              <li>âœ…By ensuring that your e-waste is proprely disposed of by ensuring that it is sent to a trustworthy
                organization such as e-Steward, ZWV and others. </li>
              <br>
              <li>âœ…By informing others about the dangers of e-waste and the steps they can take to help reduce its
                effects. </li>
              </p>
