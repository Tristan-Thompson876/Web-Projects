            <h2><i> What is a Television?</i></h2>
            <br>
            <p>The word television comes from the Greek prefix <i>tele</i> and the Latin word <i>vision</i> or
              ‚Äú<i>seeing
                from a distance.</i>‚Äù An electronic system with a screen or set of lenses that transmit transient images
              of fixed or moving objects together with sounds that are sent along cables or through space by apparatus.
              It
              converts light and sound into electrical waves or impulses to a television receiver and reconverts them
              into
              visible light rays and audible sounds.</p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <h2><i>Brief History and raw materials of televisions</i> </h2>
            <br>
            <p>The first invention of television dated back to the 1920s with black and white images but after the
              second
              world war (1940s), they started to evolve and this was due to the rise in technological advancement. Along
              with other tools, coloured TVs were introduced in the 1960s. Later, flat-screen televisions with higher
              production and improved video quality were developed in the 21st century.</p>
            <br>
            <p> Older generations of TVs contain toxic substances like lead, mercury, arsenic, cadmium, chromium and
              barium as such, they are difficult to get rid of or to be disposed of. The reduction of these substances
              in
              21st-century televisions suggests that environmental sustainability was taken into consideration. But is
              it
              enough? Will it help us overcome the problem of our "ever-lasting e-waste"? Is it only a drop in the ocean
              compared to the vast amount of e-waste we have created?

                <li>Land/Soil Pollution</li>
              </b>
              <p> When e-waste is treated as traditional waste and sent to landfills, pollution is completely
                unavoidable.
                70% oftoxic waste comes from landfills, and these landfills are becoming stricter about refusing
                e-waste.
                This increased
                the use of illegal, untreated, and improper disposal sites. When heavy metals from these devices make
                their wayinto the soil, they can seep into groundwater, leading to other bodies of water, and also
                change
                the composition and activity of the soil microbial community (Giller et al., 1998b). If crops uptake
                large
                quantities of heavy metals, this will increase the ecosystem feeding relationship and essentially cause
                health conditions to every organism that consumes it. Chronic toxic effects of heavy metals when
                consumed
                can cause gastrointestinalproblems, kidney dysfunction, nervous system disorders, vascular damage,
                cancer
                and other effects.</p>

              </b>
              <p>The increase in e-waste led to materials being mishandled. E-waste can pollute the air when improperly
                shredded,melted, or burned. The chemicals that are released while burning e-waste travel thousands of
                miles and can cause
                illnesses. The manufacturing process of e-waste contributes heavily to air pollution as the factories
                utilize different materials to make the devices, as well as emitting gases from the factory and the
                major
                machines used within the production process. </p>

              </b>
              <p>Heavy metals from televisions and other electronics can stick around in crops. Organisms are at
                increased
                risk of consuming contaminated crops. Groundwater is easily contaminated by heavy metals after seeping
                through the soil. This increases water pollution as groundwater leads to larger bodies of water, and if
                used for domestic purposes or to meet the basic needs of organisms, it may cause illnesses.

              </b>
              <p>This refers only to the Earth's rising surface temperature. Every electronic device leaves a carbon
                footprint, which adds to the global warming caused by humans(anthropogenic activities) . Electronics
                production has the potential to release 10 tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Considered across
                a
                device's lifetime, the majority of the carbon dioxide is generated during the manufacturing process,
                prior
                to the product being bought by customers. This makes low-carbon manufacturing techniques and inputs like
                the utilization of recycled raw materials and product lifetime are key factors of the environmental
                impact

              <p>The environmental impact of e-waste is linked to a rise in a variety of health concerns. Pollutants in
                e-waste can cause health concerns in plants, animals, and humans. This environmental damage has been
                tied
                to brain, heart,liver, kidney, and skeletal system damage in large animals and humans. If humans use
                polluted water for domestic purposes and it is injected into their bodies, it can be a threat to their
                health.</p>

                <li>Death to organisms</li>
              </b>
              <p>At low concentrations, it is toxic to all life, including plants, fish, birds, mammals (including
                humans), and microorganisms (Eisler 1985; Eisler 2000; Nordberg et al. 2007, ATSDR 2008). It causes
                cancer, birth defects, and genetic mutations (Eisler 2000, Nordberg et al.). Consumption of
                e-waste-polluted water can increase the mortality rate for aquatic life and terrestrial organisms like
                birds. Studies from the PLOS Medicine indicate that the accumulation of heavy metals in water
                contributes
                to eutrophication, which is the buildup of nutrients like nitrogen and phosphorus in the water,
                essentially causing death as algae thrives on the surface of water, blocks the sunlight, decreases water
                clarity, and increases the rate of precipitation.</p>

              </b>
              <p>It has been established that e-waste causes global warming through manufacturing. It does not end
                there,
                however; global warming contributes to a change in the climate, which is a long-term shift in the
                Earth‚Äôs
                temperature and
                weather patterns. This change causes hotter days and long heatwaves. 2015 was recorded as the hottest
                year-round,and 2014 previous record. From this trend, we can observe that the temperature increases
                every
                year. Rising sea level, intense extreme weather events, and ocean warming and acidification are other
                causes of climate change. The sea levels are rising due to increased ocean temperatures, which melt ice
                caps around the world. A warmer temperature results in the expansion of water‚Äôs mass, which is a threat
                to
                low-lying islands and coastal cities.Weather events like bushfires, cyclones, droughts, and floods
                increased progressively as a result of global warming. Lastly, oceans absorb the extra heat and carbon
                dioxide more than the air does, which makes the oceans
                warmer and more acidic. This bleaches coral reefs, drives stronger storms, and acts as a threat to
                shellfish, which can collapse the different ecosystem relationships.

              <p><i>‚ôªÔ∏èRe-use:</i> If you have parts and equipment that are still working try repairing the electronic
                device before getting a new one. If it is beyond repair then you can recycle it with proper care.</p>

              <br>
              <p><i>‚ôªÔ∏èRecycle:</i>You can recycle your waste using organizations like ZWV that host Electronic Recycling
                events.During this event they have trucks that collect e-waste. After the event, everything is taken to
                SBK Recycle in Tacoma and stripped of their components,crushed and removed to an appropriate processor.
                Example: Mother boards are sent to Japan for processing. Belgium and Japan are the only two countries in
                the world that has a plant that processes rare metals components safely. It is inexpensive and
                environmentally friendly to recycle rare metals
                rather than to mine them. Other major components are sent to metal recycling and LCD screens are sent to
                California. There are other organizations like ZWV and Great Lakes Electronics Corporation, so be
                informed
                and get onboard on your adventure to a world of sustainability.</p>

              <p><i>‚ôªÔ∏èRecover:</i> E-waste is usually treated by physical methods which includes: sorting, dismantling,
                size reduction and separation of metals and plastics) before it is fed into a smelting process which is
                performed in furnaces at high temperatures to liberate the valuable metals.</p>
