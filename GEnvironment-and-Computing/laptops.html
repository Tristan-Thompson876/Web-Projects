            <h2><i> What is a Laptop?</i></h2>
            <br>
            <p>A laptop, laptop computer or notebook computer is a small, portable personal computer (PC) with a screen
              and alphanumeric keyboard. Unlike desktops, laptops use a significantly reduced amount of energy due to
              their few/built-in parts like the monitor and the use of CPUs meant to maintain battery life. The toxins
              in
              laptops end up in landfills instead of the recycling centre. If these toxins end up in a landfill
              instead of a recycling centre they can contaminate groundwater, surface water or the soil.These harms show
              the need to take responsibility for the earth and stop these damages.</p>

            <img src="amd.jpg" style="height: 350px; width: 350px;">
            <p>Personal computers have gone a great way along the path of history, they first became viable in 1971
              using
              the technology of the times. Imagined by a researcher in 1972 at Xerox PARC research centre which produced
              many revolutions. He designed it in his papers and named it ‚ÄòDynabook‚Äô. The first prototype was the AMD
              special computer APL Machine Portable (SCAMP). <a

            <p> Many people think laptops produce hardly any harm. The truth is it is filled with harmful chemicals and
              heavy metals. Common chemicals found in laptops include:</p>

            <li> Lead</li>
            <li> Mercury</li>
            <li> Chromium</li>
            <li> Cadmium</li>
            <li> Brominated flame retardants</li>
            <li> Bromine</li>
            <br>
            <p>This list of chemicals is highly carcinogenic exposure can cause a number of serve health concerns such
              as
              organ failure and brain damage.
              Though these do not pose a direct risk to our health while on laptops. Instead, when they enter landfills
              instead of being recycled properly the screens, boards and metals that contain these hazardous chemicals
              are
              crushed and compacted, resulting in toxins leaking out‚Äîoftentimes into our soils and waters.

              Through being absorbed by plants these hazards enter the chain of both animals and humans causing. Many of
              these harmful chemicals are unknown to you but even ones like copper and cobolt that are heavily used in
              your leptop still have harmfull effects. <a
