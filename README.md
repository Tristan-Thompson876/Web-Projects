# Web-Projects:    Personal web
## A fully implemented website with content based on research done by myself and my group member's(Carlyon, Candace and Brandon)

The website was designed for the sole purpose of putting my skills to use in a fun way while also putting out for everyone to see just who I am and what I'm about.
